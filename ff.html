                <h3>Overall Draft Strategy</h3>
                <p>
                    Your goal in this draft is to build a well-balanced and deep roster by focusing on the best available players at RB and WR in the early rounds.
                    Start by securing top-tier talent at both positions in Rounds 1-2, ensuring you leave with at least one elite RB or WR.
                    In Rounds 3-4, continue to build balance, but be open to drafting an elite QB or TE if they fall to you.
                    As the draft progresses, prioritize depth and upside, targeting high-ceiling players who can break out or provide solid backup options.
                    Be flexible and prepared to adapt to unexpected scenarios, such as runs on QBs or TEs, and always keep an eye on value.
                    By the end of the draft, you should have a strong starting lineup with quality depth at key positions, ready to compete throughout the season.
