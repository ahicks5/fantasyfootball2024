                <p>
                    <strong>Description:</strong> The Manager Lineup Score is a comprehensive score out of 100 that evaluates the manager's effectiveness in setting their lineup. It combines several metrics to provide an overall assessment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Interpretation:</strong> Higher scores indicate better managerial decisions. A score closer to 100 suggests that the manager made excellent lineup choices, effectively maximizing their team's potential.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Factors Affecting the Score:</strong> The score considers lineup efficiency, overperformance, average percent difference, percentage of players who beat projections, percentage of players who boomed, and percentage of players who busted.

                <p>
                    <strong>Description:</strong> Lineup Efficiency measures how close the manager's chosen lineup was to the optimal actual lineup (the best possible lineup based on actual player performances).
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Interpretation:</strong> A higher percentage indicates better lineup decisions. Values close to 100% are ideal, showing that the manager nearly maximized their team's potential.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Factors Affecting Efficiency:</strong> Lineup efficiency is affected by how well the manager predicted which players would perform best. Leaving high-scoring players on the bench reduces efficiency.

                    <strong>Description:</strong> Overperformance is the difference between the chosen lineup's actual points and the projected points. It indicates how much the team exceeded or fell short of expectations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Interpretation:</strong> Positive values suggest the team performed better than expected, possibly due to players exceeding projections. Negative values indicate underperformance.

                <p>
                    <strong>Factors Affecting Overperformance:</strong> Overperformance is influenced by individual players outperforming or underperforming their projections due to various factors like matchups, injuries, or unexpected events.
